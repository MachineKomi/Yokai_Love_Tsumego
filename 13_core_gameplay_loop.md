# Core Gameplay Loops: Designing Addiction & Education

## The Philosophy: "Juicy puzzles and romance"

The central challenge is that Tsumego (Go puzzles) are high-cognitive-load tasks. They can be dry and frustrating.

To make this daily and addictive, we must wrap the "pain" of thinking in thick layers of instant gratification, sensory reward, and long-term emotional investment. Every correct move must feel like a critical hit in an RPG, and every return session must feel like visiting a friend.

### 1. The Immediate Loop: "The Tactile Crunch"
**Scope:** Seconds to 1 Minute (A single puzzle attempt).
**Goal:** Make the act of thinking and placing a stone feel physically satisfying.

**Phase 1: The Puzzle (Mental)**
*   **Action:** The player solves a Go problem.
*   **Feedback:** Juicy "THWACK" sound and particle effects.
*   **Result:** Success charges "Mana" for the Auto-Battle phase.

**Phase 2: The Auto-Battle (Visual)**
*   **Action:** Watch your team of Yokai attack the enemy based on your puzzle performance.
*   **Feedback:** Flashy skills, damage numbers, Waifu cheers.
### 2. The Short-Term Loop: "The Tower Floor Session"
**Scope:** 5 to 15 Minutes (A single play session).
**Goal:** Induce a "Flow State" using streaks and manageable goals.

*   **The Streak Mechanic (Addictive):**
    *   Solving puzzles consecutively builds a "Purification Streak" (Mana Streak) meter.
    *   **Mana Streak:** Breaks on **failure**. Rewards Mana & Aji. (Max 2 Shields/Day).
    *   **Study Streak:** Breaks on **inactivity (>36 hours)**. Rewards compounding bonuses. (Max 2 Shields/Week).
    *   Higher streaks grant exponential multipliers on Mana Stones.
*   **The "Just One More" Hook:** Upon clearing a floor, the game immediately shows a preview of the next floor's rewards.
*   **Session Cap (Casual):** An Energy/Stamina system limits how many floors they can grind in one sitting without paying.

### 3. The Medium-Term Loop: "Affection & Ascension"
**Scope:** Days to Weeks.
**Goal:** Convert short-term gains (currency/XP) into permanent progress and narrative rewards.

*   **The Sink (Dating Sim):** Players spend Mana Stones on Gifts for their active Yokai companion to raise "Affection Level."
*   **The Reward Gate (Narrative):** Reaching Affection milestones unlocks new "Memory Crystals" (Visual Novel scenes).
*   **The Boss Walls (Recruitment):**
    *   Every 10 floors, progress is blocked by a "Boss Node".
    *   Defeating a boss grants **Shards** or unlocks their **Summon Banner**, allowing the player to pull for them in the Gacha.

### 4. The Long-Term Loop: "The Forever Climb"
**Scope:** Months to Years.
**Goal:** Retention, mastery, and high-level prestige.

*   **Infinite Scaling:** The tower keeps getting taller, and puzzles keep getting harder.
*   **Spaced Repetition:** The tower algorithm secretly re-introduces puzzle *types* the player struggled with.
*   **Ascension (Prestige):** Upon reaching Floor 100, the player can "Ascend" to reset progress for permanent buffs and "Divine Rank".
