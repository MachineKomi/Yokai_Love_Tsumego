Here is the **Tone and Appeal Bible**. This document acts as the "Vibe Check" for every asset, line of dialogue, and UI element generated by the AI agents. It ensures that the intellectual rigor of Go doesn't clash with the playful dating sim elements, but rather enhances them.

# Tone & Appeal Bible: The "Yokai Love Tsumego" Vibe
**Project:** Yokai Love Tsumego
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Context:** This document guides Art Direction, Sound Design, UI/UX, and Narrative Writing.

---

## 1. The Core Emotional Pillar: "Intellectual Heroism"

The central fantasy of *Yokai Love Tsumego* is that **intelligence is attractive.**

* **The Feeling:** The player should feel like a genius tactician. When they solve a hard puzzle, the game treats it like slaying a dragon. The screen shakes, the audio booms, and the Waifu cheers.
* **The Feedback Loop:** Hard work (Thinking) $\rightarrow$ Instant Validation (Visuals/Sound) $\rightarrow$ Social Reward (Waifu Affection).
* **Contrast:** We bridge the gap between the silent, stoic atmosphere of a traditional Go salon and the hyper-energetic, dopamine-heavy atmosphere of a gacha game.

## 2. Visual Identity: "Cyber-Fantasy JRPG"

We are aiming for a specific intersection of aesthetics: **Traditional Japanese Folklore x High-Gloss Anime UI.**

### A. Art Style (For AI Prompts)
* **Base Model Style:** Niji Journey v6 / Stable Diffusion Anime Checkpoints (e.g., AnythingXL).
* **Keywords:** *Cel-shaded, 4k, Detailed Backgrounds, Vibrant Colors, Atmospheric Lighting, Makoto Shinkai clouds, Persona 5 UI slickness.*
* **Character Design:**
    * **Yokai:** Traditional elements (kimonos, fox ears, oni horns) mixed with modern or sci-fi accessories (headphones, tablets, futuristic fabrics).
    * **Goddesses:** Ethereal, glowing, floating data streams, "Digital Divinity."
* **The "Juice" (VFX):**
    * The Go board is not just wood; it is a magical artifact.
    * **Winning Move:** Golden particle explosion, screen shake, "CRITICAL HIT" style typography.
    * **Teaching Mode:** Tron-like glowing grid lines. The "Emotional Aura" should look like heat distortion or spiritual pressure (Reiatsu).

### B. UI/UX "Feel"
* **Inspiration:** *Persona 5*, *ZZZ (Zenless Zone Zero)*, *HuniePop*.
* **Rule:** Never boring. Menus should snap, slide, and bounce.
* **Color Palette:**
    * **Primary:** Deep Indigo (Night Sky), Gold (Victory), Sakura Pink (Romance).
    * **Functional:** Slate Grey (Board Background) to reduce eye strain during puzzles.

### C. Combat Visuals (RPG Layer)
* **Style:** **Abstract & Text-Heavy.** We do *not* use animated battle sprites (chibis).
* **Components:**
    * **Static Portraits:** High-quality, expressive character art that reacts to damage/victory.
    * **Combat Log:** A fast-scrolling, detailed text log describing the action (e.g., *"Ren casts Fox Fire! It's super effective!"*).
    * **Overlay Effects:** Juicy particle explosions, floating damage numbers, and shaking HP bars over the background art.
    * **Limit Breaks:** A dedicated "Cut-in" animation (static image slide + intense VFX) when a player triggers an ultimate.

## 3. The "Ecchi" Boundary & Safety

We are making a **Spicy T-Rated/M-Rated Game**, not an AO (Adults Only) H-Game.

* **The Goal:** "Thirsty but Wholesome." The appeal is romance, intimacy, and suggestiveness, not explicit pornography.
* **Steam Safe:** The content must remain within Steam's guidelines for "Ecchi" games.
    * **Allowed:** Cleavage, swimsuits, suggestive poses, blushing, "accidentally" torn clothes (battle damage), intense romantic gazes.
    * **Banned:** Nudity, visible genitalia, explicit sexual acts.
* **Narrative Tone:**
    * The Waifus are *flirty* and *teasing*, but the interactions build towards emotional connection.
    * **Key Inspiration:** *Bunny Garden* or *Tokimeki Memorial*. The "chase" is more fun than the "catch."

---

## 4. Audio Direction (Sensory Hooks)

Since this is a puzzle game, the audio landscape is repetitive. It must be ASMR-quality.

* **The "Stone Sound":** This is the most important sound effect in the game. It must be a crisp, resonant *thwack* (like a slate stone hitting a kaya board). Vary the pitch slightly per move to create a melody.
* **Voice Acting (AI):**
    * **Success:** Enthusiastic praise. *"Sugoi!"*, *"Tensai!" (Genius)*, *"As expected of my Master."*
    * **Failure:** Gentle teasing or disappointment. *"Ara ara, distracted?"*, *"Focus, darling."*
* **Music:**
    * **Climbing/Puzzles:** Lo-Fi Hip Hop x Shamisen (Traditional Japanese strings). Relaxing, conducive to thinking.
    * **Boss Floors:** High-tempo Electro-Swing or Symphonic Metal. High stakes.
    * **Dating Scenes:** Bossa Nova, Piano Jazz, warm and cozy.

---

## 5. Psychological Hooks (Why it's Addictive)

We leverage specific psychological drivers to keep players returning.

### A. The "Flow State" (The Streak)
* **Mechanic:** Solving 2, 4, 8, 16 puzzles in a row builds a visual meter (fire/lightning).
* **Psychology:** Loss Aversion. "I can't stop now, I have a 32x streak!" This pushes the player to do "just one more floor."

### B. The "Parasocial Mentor"
* **Mechanic:** The Waifu learns *with* you.
* **Narrative:** When the player levels up from 15kyu to 10kyu, the Waifu comments on it. *"You used to struggle with that shape, look at you now!"*
* **Appeal:** It feels like the game cares about your personal growth.

### C. The "Gacha" Dopamine (Without the Gambling)
* **Mechanic:** Unlocking a new Waifu or a new Outfit uses the same visual language as opening a Loot Box (bright lights, anticipation), but it is earned through skill (clearing floors), not just luck.

---

## 6. Narrative Themes & Writing Style

* **Theme:** "Order from Chaos." The Tower is a chaotic place of wild magic (bad moves/blunders). The Player brings Order (good shape/Tesuji).
* **Dialogue Style:**
    * **Modern/Meta:** Characters are aware of Go terms. They use slang like "Tesuji," "Aji," "Tenuki" in casual conversation.
    * **Example:** *Tsundere Character:* "I-It's not like I left that cut open for you on purpose! It was a probe! B-Baka!"
* **The Player Avatar:** A silent protagonist, but one defined by **Focus** and **Determination**.

---

## 7. Accessibility & Inclusivity (The Go Barrier)

Go is intimidating. The tone must be **Welcoming**.

* **Never Punish Ignorance:** When a player fails, the game should say "Let's learn why," not "You are wrong."
* **Visualizing Logic:** Use the "Emotional Auras" to make invisible concepts (influence/territory) visible. Make the player feel like they have "Super Vision."
