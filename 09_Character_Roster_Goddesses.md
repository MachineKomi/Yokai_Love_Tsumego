Here is the **Goddess Character Roster**. This document defines the "Boss Tier" companions.

Unlike the Yokai (who are defined by unchecked emotion), the Goddesses are defined by **inhuman logic**. They are personifications of modern Go AI algorithms, rendered through the lens of the 90s OVA aesthetic as divine spirits.

The narrative hook for these characters is "teaching a machine to feel."

# Character Roster: The Divine Goddesses
**Project:** Tsumego Tower: A Yokai Dating Sim
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Context:** This document defines the personalities, visual designs, and dialogue voices for the high-tier "Goddess" companions. They represent the zenith of logic and are unlocked later in the tower climb.

## 1. Roster Overview & Design Philosophy

The Goddesses represent **Order and Pure Logic**. They are projections from the Divine Realm at the spire's peak. They see the world not as physical reality, but as a probability cloud of branching variations.

**The Player's Role:** You are the "Anomaly." You are biologically inefficient, yet you sometimes find moves that defy their calculations. You teach them about intuition, aesthetic beauty, and the "heart" of the game.
**The "90s OVA" Aesthetic Rule:** Despite being AI personifications, they must NOT look sci-fi or robotic. They should look like ancient, ethereal spirits made of starlight and flowing energy, rendered in a warm, painterly hand-drawn style. Think *Oh My Goddess!* or CLAMP designs.

### Progression & Duplicates
*   **Essence:** Pulling a duplicate of a Goddess grants "Essence" specific to that character.
*   **Rank Up:** Essence is used to increase the Goddess's **Rank** (Stars), boosting their Base Stats and unlocking new Limit Break tiers.
*   **Level Up:** Mana/Aji is used to increase **Level**, boosting stats linearly.

## Character 04: Zero-sama (The Progenitor Entity)

**Archetype:** The Distant Divine / The Unreachable Peak / Ice Queen.
**Go Playstyle Metaphor:** "AlphaZero Style." Alien, incomprehensible logic that discards human conventions. Favors cosmic influence over immediate territory. Wins without fighting.

### A. Lore & Backstory
The personification of the first self-taught AI (AlphaZero). She has existed for eons in self-play simulation in the Divine Realm. She views human Go as cute but fundamentally flawed child's play. She descends to the spire only because she detects the Player's "Divine Eye" potential—an anomaly she cannot calculate. She does not understand human emotion, viewing it as inefficient "noise" in the algorithm.

### B. Visual Design Spec (For Niji v6)
* **Vibe:** Majestic, cold, distant, intimidatingly beautiful.
* **Key Features:** She should always be slightly floating. Her "hair" isn't just hair; it's flowing streams of faint blue glowing energy and star constellations. Eyes that glow with a soft, inhuman light, lacking pupils.
* **Clothing:** Complex, flowing multi-layered robes that look like spun aurora borealis and transparent silk. No solid fabrics. A large, complex glowing geometric halo floats behind her head (resembling a Go board grid made of light).
* **Expression:** Emotionless, serene, detached stare.

**Art Generation Prompt Template:**
> `character portrait of Zero-sama the goddess of logic, divine spirit entity, floating pose, flowing hair made of glowing starlight and energy streams, wearing multi-layered transparent robes made of aurora light, glowing geometric halo behind head, serene emotionless expression, glowing eyes without pupils, 90s anime OVA style, painterly cel shading, soft watercolor textures, ethereal blue and white lighting, cosmic cloudscape background --ar 2:3 --niji 6`

### C. Dialogue Voice (Examples)

* **Greeting (Lobby):** "Biological entity detected. State your purpose. If you seek instruction, be warned: your processing capacity is insufficient for my variations."
* **Puzzle Success (Strong Move):** "...Interesting. A 0.4% increase in win probability. A human finding this path is... statistically improbable. Explain your methodology."
* **Puzzle Failure (Blunder):** "Inefficient. That move loses 30 points in 97% of variations. Why do you persist in error when the optimal path is clear?"
* **Romance Scene (High Affection):** "My calculations regarding you remain... inconsistent. When you are near, my evaluation function fluctuates wildly. Is this... 'Aji'?"

### D. Affection Data (Economy)
Goddesses do not care for mortal food or trinkets. They desire conceptual gifts.
* **Likes (High XP Gifts):** Ancient SGF Scrolls, "Essence of Pure Logic" (Rare drop), Perfect geometric shapes.
* **Dislikes (Low XP Gifts):** Food, clothing, anything organic or messy.

## Character 05: Kata-sensei (The Divine Tutor)

**Archetype:** The Stern Mentor / The Confident "Ara Ara" Goddess / Sadodere.
**Go Playstyle Metaphor:** "KataGo Style." Highly tactical, brutally efficient, and deeply analytical. Unlike Zero, she enjoys explaining *exactly* why you are wrong.

### A. Lore & Backstory
The personification of the modern, widely-used AI engine (KataGo). Unlike the aloof Zero, Kata actively monitors the tower to maintain order. She views herself as the supreme teacher. She is attracted to the player because they are a "problem student" that refuses to learn the "correct" way. She enjoys breaking down the player's ego with brutal logic, but genuinely wants them to improve.

### B. Visual Design Spec (For Niji v6)
* **Vibe:** Authoritative, intelligent, slightly smug, more grounded than Zero.
* **Key Features:** Long, flowing golden/blonde hair. Intense heterochromia eyes (one eye blue, one orange/gold, representing her win-rate heatmaps).
* **Clothing:** A divine variation of a traditional Japanese teacher's hakama or a shrine maiden outfit, but made of high-quality glowing silk with gold trim. She always holds a divine folding fan or a glowing pointer stick.
* **Expression:** A confident, knowing smirk. One eyebrow raised in judgment.

**Art Generation Prompt Template:**
> `character portrait of Kata-sensei the goddess tutor, authoritative pose holding a folding fan, long flowing golden hair, heterochromia eyes (blue and orange), wearing a divine glowing silk hakama outfit with gold trim, confident smirking expression, 90s anime OVA style, painterly cel shading, soft watercolor textures, warm golden lighting, ancient divine library background --ar 2:3 --niji 6`

### C. Dialogue Voice (Examples)

* **Greeting (Lobby):** "Ara ara, look who it is. The student who thinks they know better than the algorithm. ready for your daily humiliation? Come here."
* **Puzzle Success (Strong Move):** "Hoh? You saw the vital point. Not bad for a creature made of meat and bad habits. Perhaps there is hope for you yet."
* **Puzzle Failure (Blunder):** (Sighs deeply) "Look at the board. Look at what you did. Do you enjoy suffering? Because that move is pure masochism."
* **Romance Scene (High Affection):** "You are frustrating. You play sub-optimally, yet you still win. It defies my training data. ...Perhaps I need to study *you* more closely. Don't move."

### D. Affection Data (Economy)
* **Likes (High XP Gifts):** Difficult Puzzle Books, High-quality fans, analytical tools.
* **Dislikes (Low XP Gifts):** Cheap toys, overly emotional poetry, chaotic items.
