Here is the **Story and World Bible**. This document provides the narrative foundation for the game. It explains *why* playing Go fights monsters and defines the relationships between the player, the world, and the waifus.

It is structured to give clear instructions to human writers or AI text generation agents regarding tone, character voices, and world-logic boundaries.

## 1. The Core Premise (The "Why")

**The World is Chaos. Logic is Magic.**

Reality is maintained by the "Great Resonance"—a cosmic harmony composed of perfect logic and balance. The physical manifestation of this resonance is the **Celestial Spire**.

**The Conflict:** The **Demon Lord** has risen and banned the practice of Go, declaring it "dangerous magic." He has shrouded the Spire in the **Miasma of Doubt**, a corruption born from cognitive bias and fear.

**The Hook:** Conventional weapons cannot harm the Miasma. It can only be dispelled by asserting **Order**. Placing stones in the perfect, logical sequence (solving a Tsumego) creates a harmonic resonance that purifies the area and weakens the Demon Lord's grip.

## 2. The Protagonist: "The Climber" (The Player)

The Player is a silent protagonist, an avatar for self-insertion.

* **Who You Are:** A human with a rare, innate ability known as the "Divine Eye" (神の一手, *Kami no Itte* potential). You can see the currents of logic and chaos on a Go board instantly.
* **Your Goal:** To ascend the Infinite Spire, purify the Miasma, and restore the Great Resonance.
* **Your Role in Romance:** You are the "Anchor." The Yokai are powerful but chaotic and emotional. The Goddesses are logical but cold and detached. They both need your unique balance of human heart and divine logic to reach their full potential. You don't just date them; you complete them.

## 3. The Companions (Waifus)

The companions are spirits trapped or dwelling within the Spire's different strata.

### A. The Yokai (Spirits of Emotion)
* **Origin:** Manifestations of folklore and nature trapped in the lower to mid-levels of the tower.
* **Nature:** They are creatures of pure instinct and emotion. They possess raw power but lack discipline, often falling victim to their own chaotic natures (making them "bad at Go" initially).
* **Relationship Dynamic:** "The Taming of the Shrew." The player uses logic to help focus their chaotic energy. The romance comes from the Yokai learning to trust and submit to the player's guiding intellect, transforming from wild spirits into devoted partners.
* **Example Archetypes:**
    *   **Tama (Starter):** A cheeky Neko Yokai who guides you (for snacks).
    *   **Ren:** The mischievous Kitsune who pranks you when you miss a Tesuji.
    *   **Kagara:** The aggressive Oni who wants to smash the board.

### B. The Goddesses (Spirits of Logic)
* **Origin:** Astral projections from the Divine Realm at the tower's zenith. They are personifications of supreme algorithms (e.g., AlphaZero, KataGo).
* **Nature:** They are beings of pure, cold efficiency. They see the optimal move instantly but do not understand *why* humans struggle, fear, or love. They view the Miasma as a mere calculation error to be debugged.
* **Relationship Dynamic:** "Pinocchio learning to be real." The player teaches them about intuition, aesthetic beauty in a move, and the "human element" of Go. The romance stems from the Goddess experiencing emotion for the first time through their connection with the player.

## 4. Narrative Structure

The game utilizes a hybrid narrative structure separating the high-stakes main plot from intimacy.

### A. The Main Quest (Vertical Progression)
* **Where it happens:** The Tower Climb gameplay loop.
* **Tone:** Epic, tense, focused on action and mystery.
* **Structure:** Linear progression. Every 10 floors, a "Boss Node" reveals a fragment of the Spire's history or the origin of the Miasma before a major puzzle battle.

### B. The Romance Routes (Horizontal Progression)
* **Where it happens:** The "Home Base" (Lobby) and unlockable "Memory Crystals" (Visual Novel scenes).
* **Tone:** Cozy, intimate, flirtatious, and sometimes comedic. The aesthetic is "Nostalgic 90s OVA slice-of-life."
* **Structure:** Episodic. As Affection increases, new standalone scenes unlock that deepen the bond between the Player and that specific Companion. These scenes are disconnected from the current floor level of the main quest.

## 5. Dialogue & Tone Guidelines (For AI Agents)

All generated text must adhere to these rules to maintain the "Nostalgic Romance" vibe.

### A. The "Vibe Check"
* **Target Era:** Think anime dubbed in the late 90s/early 2000s. Earnest, slightly melodramatic, heartfelt, and unapologetically romantic.
* **Forbidden:** Do NOT use modern internet slang (no "rizz," "bet," "cringe," "based"). Do NOT break the fourth wall heavily or use cynical, self-aware humor that undermines the fantasy setting.

### B. Go Metaphors
Characters view the world through the lens of Go. Use terms metaphorically in romance scenes.
* *Good:* "You captured my heart in a ladder; I have nowhere left to run."
* *Good:* "Your approach is too aggressive! You need to build influence first before invading my personal space."
* *Bad:* "Wow you are good at the board game Go." (Too literal).

### C. The Ecchi Boundary (Safety Guidelines)
The romance is spicy but suggestive. It relies on implication and reaction, not explicit description.
* **Focus on Reaction:** Instead of describing a physical action explicitly, describe the character's reaction to it (blushing intensely, stammering, steam rising from their head, tail wagging furiously).
* **The "Fade to White":** If a scene reaches a point of intense intimacy, imply the conclusion and fade the scene. Do not generate explicit anatomical descriptions or sexual acts. Keep it "Steam-safe."

## 6. Summary: The Core Conflict

The central tension of the story is **Heart vs. Mind**.

* The **Miasma** is unbridled emotion without logic.
* The **Goddesses** are pure logic without emotion.
* The **Yokai** are pure emotion struggling for logic.
* The **Player** is the bridge—the only being capable of harmonizing Heart and Mind to ascend the tower.
