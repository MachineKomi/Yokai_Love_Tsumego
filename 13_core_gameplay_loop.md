# Core Gameplay Loops: Designing Addiction & Education

## The Philosophy: "Juicy puzzles and romance"

The central challenge is that Tsumego (Go puzzles) are high-cognitive-load tasks. They can be dry and frustrating.
*   **Feedback:** Flashy skills, damage numbers, Waifu cheers.
### 2. The Short-Term Loop: "The Tower Floor Session"
**Scope:** 5 to 15 Minutes (A single play session).
**Goal:** Induce a "Flow State" using streaks and manageable goals.

*   **The Streak Mechanic (Addictive):**
    *   Solving puzzles consecutively builds a "Purification Streak" (Mana Streak) meter.
    *   **Mana Streak:** Breaks on **failure**. Rewards Mana & Aji. (Max 2 Shields/Day).
    *   **Study Streak:** Breaks on **inactivity (>36 hours)**. Rewards compounding bonuses. (Max 2 Shields/Week).
    *   Higher streaks grant exponential multipliers on Mana Stones.
*   **The "Just One More" Hook:** Upon clearing a floor, the game immediately shows a preview of the next floor's rewards.
*   **Session Cap (Casual):** An Energy/Stamina system limits how many floors they can grind in one sitting without paying.

### 3. The Medium-Term Loop: "Affection & Ascension"
**Scope:** Days to Weeks.
**Goal:** Convert short-term gains (currency/XP) into permanent progress and narrative rewards.

*   **The Sink (Dating Sim):** Players spend Mana Stones on Gifts for their active Yokai companion to raise "Affection Level."
*   **The Reward Gate (Narrative):** Reaching Affection milestones unlocks new "Memory Crystals" (Visual Novel scenes).
*   **The Boss Walls (Recruitment):**
    *   Every 10 floors, progress is blocked by a "Boss Node".
    *   Defeating a boss grants **Shards** or unlocks their **Summon Banner**, allowing the player to pull for them in the Gacha.

### 4. The Long-Term Loop: "The Forever Climb"
**Scope:** Months to Years.
**Goal:** Retention, mastery, and high-level prestige.

*   **Infinite Scaling:** The tower keeps getting taller, and puzzles keep getting harder.
*   **Spaced Repetition:** The tower algorithm secretly re-introduces puzzle *types* the player struggled with.
*   **Ascension (Prestige):** Upon reaching Floor 100, the player can "Ascend" to reset progress for permanent buffs and "Divine Rank".
