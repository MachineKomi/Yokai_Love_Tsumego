# Game Drop-in Pack (Go Content Integration)

Copy this entire `game_dropin/` folder into the main game repo. It defines the expected on-disk layout, JSON schemas, and sample content files for early integration testing.

## What’s inside

- `game_dropin/FILE_STRUCTURE.md`: The file/folder layout the game should load for **tsumego** and **joseki**.
- `game_dropin/schemas/`: JSON Schemas for validating content.
- `game_dropin/samples/`: Sample puzzles/trees + an example `index.json` manifest.
